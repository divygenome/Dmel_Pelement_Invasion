The intra-population hybrid dysgenesis experiment was performed at every 5th generation until generation 50. 
We collected the flies, which were 7-10 days old, let them lay eggs for 2 days at 29C, and then removed them. 
We reared the eggs until adult eclosion. Later, we collected the flies in cages with apple-agar plates and yeast paste and left them in the cages for two days at 25C. 
Later on, we dissected more than 70 flies (more than 70 pairs of ovaries) to check their development. 
We scored normal (1), intermediate (0.5) and dysgenic (0) based on their dysgenesis level. 
We used only one replicate for this experiment and we always had HD control performed for every experiment by making crosses using Harwich (P-strain) and Dm68 (M-strain).
