The three single copy genes (SCGs) used in the copy number estimations of the DeviaTE tool needed to be validated. To achieve this, we ran an NCBI blast comparison of the three SCG sequences (rhino, ribosomal protein L32 and traffic jam) against the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome ISO1, achieving the following results.

# SCG rhino

# SCG ribosomal protein L32

# SCG traffic jam
